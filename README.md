Welcome to the Knowledge Distillation Projects repository! This repository houses a collection of projects focused on implementing and exploring knowledge distillation techniques in machine learning. Knowledge distillation is a process where a "student" model is trained to replicate the behavior of a "teacher" model, often resulting in a smaller, faster, and more efficient model while retaining high-performance levels.

# Installation

To get started with the projects, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/knowledge-distillation-projects.git
cd knowledge-distillation-projects
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Projects
Image Classification

Explore how knowledge distillation can improve the performance of smaller models on image classification tasks. This project includes implementations using popular datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet.
Natural Language Processing

Apply knowledge distillation to NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, text classification, and machine translation. This project demonstrates distillation techniques with models like BERT, GPT, and their student counterparts.
Reinforcement Learning

Learn about the application of knowledge distillation in reinforcement learning environments. This project showcases how to distill knowledge from complex models to simpler ones in game playing and robotic control tasks.
Usage

Each project directory contains a README file with specific instructions on how to run the experiments. Generally, you will need to follow these steps:

    Prepare the dataset.
    Train the teacher model (if not already provided).
    Train the student model using the distillation technique.
    Evaluate the student model's performance.
